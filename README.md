# üìÅ Java File Handling Utility

## üßæ Project Overview

**Java File Handling Utility** is a simple, interactive console-based Java application that demonstrates how to perform basic file operations like writing, reading, appending, and modifying file content. It is designed primarily for beginners who want to learn Java I/O (Input/Output) operations using `FileWriter`, `Files`, `Paths`, and `Scanner` classes.

The project features a **menu-driven system** that allows users to select operations to perform on a predefined file (`sample.txt`). This tool is ideal for those who want a foundational understanding of file handling in Java.

## üéØ Features

1. **Write to File (Overwrite)** ‚Äì Users can input text and save it to a file, replacing any previous content.  
2. **Append to File** ‚Äì Appends new content to the existing file without deleting the old content.  
3. **Read File** ‚Äì Reads and displays the entire content of the file line by line.  
4. **Modify Text in File** ‚Äì Allows users to search for specific text and replace it with new text.  
5. **Exit** ‚Äì Cleanly terminates the program.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java SE 17+  
- FileWriter & Scanner for I/O  
- java.nio.file.Files & Paths for modern file handling  
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code (any Java-supported IDE)  
- Command Line Interface (CLI)


## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or above  
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code) or terminal with Java installed  

### Steps

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the project folder in your IDE.  
3. Compile and run the `FileUtility.java` file.  
4. Follow the menu options displayed in the terminal.

## üí° Example Usage

==== File Handling Utility ====

1) Write to file (overwrite)

2) Append to file

3) Read file

4) Modify text in file

5) Exit
   
Choose an option (1-5):


- If you choose **1**, it will ask for input and overwrite the existing content.  
- If you choose **2**, it will append your input to the file.  
- **3** will display current file content.  
- **4** allows search and replace operations.

## üß† Learning Outcomes

- Understanding basic file operations in Java  
- Learning to use `FileWriter` and `Scanner` effectively  
- Using `Files.readAllLines()` and `Files.writeString()` from `java.nio.file`  
- Exception handling using `try-with-resources` and `catch` blocks  
- Designing user-friendly CLI menus

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Clean, modular methods for each operation  
- Safe resource management using `try-with-resources`  
- Can be extended to support multiple files, logs, or file type filters  
- Great for learning and teaching Java I/O
